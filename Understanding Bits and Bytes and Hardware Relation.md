Understanding Bits and Bytes and Hardware Relation

### Understanding Bits and Bytes:
##### Understanding Bit and Byte:
Bits:
- A **bit** (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in computing and can have a value of 0 or 1.
Bytes:
* A **byte** is a collection of 8 bits. This is the standard size of a byte in most modern systems.
* A byte is often used to represent a single character in text (e.g., ASCII encoding).

##### To Calculate amount of bits in a Byte (Base and Power):
- since a `bit` can only hold 2 values (0 or 1),  2 will be the base -> so if we have 4 bytes that means there are 32 bits in 4 bytes:  
  - because -> 4 bytes -> each byte is 8 bits so 4 (bytes) x 8 (bits that each byte holds) = 32 bits in total
- the base will be 2 because there can only be two possible values, and the exponent is X amount or the times we are multiplying the base by.

##### Base and Power in Binary Numbers:
In binary numbers:
* **Base (2)**: The binary system is base 2 because each digit (bit) can only take one of two values: 0 or 1.
* **Exponent (Power)**: The power corresponds to the positional weight of each bit, increasing from right to left.
