# ðŸ“‚ Important Directories in Linux
| **Directory** | **Description** |
|:-:|:-:|
| / **(Root)** | The top-level directory that contains all other directories. Everything in Linux starts from here. |
| /bin | Contains essential user binaries (executables), like ls, cp, mv, cat, etc. |
| /sbin | Contains system binaries used by the root user, like fsck, reboot, ifconfig. |
| /boot | Contains boot loader files (e.g., grub), kernel images (vmlinuz), and initramfs. |
| /dev | Contains device files, such as sda (hard disk), tty (terminals), null, random. |
| /etc | System-wide configuration files (passwd, shadow, hosts, resolv.conf, etc.). |
| /home | Contains user home directories (/home/user for each user). |
| /lib | Shared libraries required for system programs and the kernel. |
| /lib64 | Stores 64-bit shared libraries (used on 64-bit systems). |
| /media | Mount point for removable media like USB drives, CDs (/media/cdrom). |
| /mnt | Temporary mount point for manually mounted filesystems. |
| /opt | Used for third-party software installations (e.g., Google Chrome, Zoom). |
| /proc | Virtual filesystem that provides system and process information (/proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo). |
| /root | Home directory of the root (admin) user (/home/root is NOT used). |
| /run | Stores system and process runtime data (temporary files since the last boot). |
| /srv | Contains service-related data (e.g., website files for a web server). |
| /sys | Provides kernel-related information similar to /proc (device details). |
| /tmp | Temporary directory for storing files that are deleted on reboot. |
| /usr | Contains user binaries (/usr/bin), libraries (/usr/lib), and documentation (/usr/share). |
| /usr/local | Stores software installed manually instead of using package managers. |
| /var | Stores variable data like logs (/var/log), mail (/var/mail), and cache (/var/cache). |
